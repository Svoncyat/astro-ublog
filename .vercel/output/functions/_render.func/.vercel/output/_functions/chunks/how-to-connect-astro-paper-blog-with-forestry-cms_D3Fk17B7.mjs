You can [read their announcement](https://forestry.io/blog/forestry.io-end-of-life/) for more info.\n\nIn this article, I will explain step by step process of connecting AstroPaper theme with the Forestry headless CMS. So, let's get started ðŸŽ‰\n\n## Table of contents\n\n## What is Forestry?\n\n[Forestry](https://forestry.io/ \"Forestry Website\") is a git-based headless CMS and we can manage our markdown contents easily by using that. Although it is not an open-sourced CMS, it has a good free plan by which we can import up to 3 sites (3 repositories). In this article, I'll demonstrate how we can use Forestry as git-based CMS of our AstroPaper blog theme.\n\n## Login / Register an account at Forestry.io\n\nFirst of all, you have to create an account at [Forestry website](https://app.forestry.io/login \"Forestry Login Page\"). I usually sign up with my Github account.\n\n![Forestry Login page](https://res.cloudinary.com/noezectz/v1663739096/astro-paper/Forestry-io_hk5yzv.png)\n\n## Import AstroPaper site (repository)\n\nThis part is importing the repository to Forestry and a little bit of set up process.\n\n### Add Site\n\nAfter logging in/signing up an account, import your AstroPaper site by clicking \"Add Site\" button.\n\n![Forestry 'My sites' page](https://res.cloudinary.com/noezectz/v1663739752/astro-paper/Forestry-io_1_z1bdyd.png)\n\n### Select SSG\n\nIn this case, just choose \"Others\"\n\n![Selecting 'Others' as a site generator](https://res.cloudinary.com/noezectz/v1663740872/astro-paper/Forestry-io_2_blrrw2.png)\n\n### Select Git Provider\n\nMy git provider is Github and I assume yours is the same. So, choose \"Github\".\n\n![Selecting Github as a git provider](https://res.cloudinary.com/noezectz/v1663740922/astro-paper/Forestry-io_3_pj1v8v.png)\n\nAfter this, the process of importing site (repo) is done.\n\n## Set up Sidebar\n\nThe next phase after importing site is setting up sidebar menu. You can add many sidebar menu as you want. However, I'll only add one sidebar menu in this case.\n\nNavigate to \"Finish setup process\" > \"Set up sidebar\" and click \"Configure sitebar\"\n\n![Forestry welcome screen](https://res.cloudinary.com/noezectz/v1663740974/astro-paper/forestry-io_4_j35uk9.png)\n\nThen, click \"Add Section\" button.\n\n![Clicking 'Add Section' for sidebar](https://res.cloudinary.com/noezectz/v1663741011/astro-paper/forestry-io_5_sxtgvx.png)\n\nAfter that, choose DIRECTORY for the Section Type.\n\n![Choosing 'DIRECTORY' as the Selection Type](https://res.cloudinary.com/noezectz/v1663741052/astro-paper/forestry-io_6_lddmkx.png)\n\nThen, configure the directory section. You can follow along with my setup.\n\n![Configuring the Directory Section](https://res.cloudinary.com/noezectz/v1663741105/astro-paper/forestry-io_7_jkwgi1.png)\n\nAfter this step, you should see a sidebar menu \"Blog Posts\" and some blog posts.\n\n## Set up Media Import\n\nIn Forestry CMS, you can set up different options for media (aka assets) such as Cloudinary, git commit media etc. I usually store my assets in [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). To set up media import, go to Settings > Media. Then select your image storage provider. (I chose Cloudinary).\n\n![Setting up 'Cloudinary' as the media import](https://res.cloudinary.com/noezectz/v1663741636/astro-paper/forestry-io-media-import_1_f8i4lm.png)\n\nYou can see details of Forestry Cloudinary setup at [Forestry documentation](https://forestry.io/docs/media/cloudinary/).\n\n## Set up Front matter template\n\nAfter setting everything up, you can set up front matter template for your future blog post. To set up front matter template, navigate to \"Front matter\" menu on the sidebar.\n\nThen, click \"Add Template\" button at the top right corner.\n\n![Front Matter Templates page](https://res.cloudinary.com/noezectz/v1663742060/astro-paper/forestry-io-frontmatter_yskfvn.png)\n\nSelect new template based on existing document.\n\n![Creating new template based on existing document](https://res.cloudinary.com/noezectz/v1663742179/astro-paper/forestry-io-existing-doc_bwcb9q.png)\n\nThen, add template name and choose one of my document page as template.\n\nAs the final setup, make some adjustment in the front matter field settings.\n\n![Making some adjustment in a front matter field setting](https://res.cloudinary.com/noezectz/v1663742450/astro-paper/forestry-io-fm-config_jqmgwz.png)\n\nHere are some adjustments you have to make.\n\n**_title_**\n\n- Validation => REQUIRED => true\n\n**_author_**\n\n- Default => your name\n\n**_datetime_**\n\n- Default => USE \"NOW\" AS DEFAULT\n\n**_description_**\n\n- Validation => REQUIRED => true\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYou can now post your articles and write whatever you want.\n";
