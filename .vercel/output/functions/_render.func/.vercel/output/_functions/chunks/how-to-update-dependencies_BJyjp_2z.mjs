One way to do it is by manually updating each package using <code>npm install package-name@latest</code>. This method is the most straightforward way of updating. However, it may not be the most efficient option.</p>\n<p>My recommended way of updating dependencies is by using the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates\">npm-check-updates package</a>. There‚Äôs a good <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-update-npm-dependencies/\">article</a> from freeCodeCamp about that, so I won‚Äôt be explaining the details of what it is and how to use that package. Instead, I‚Äôll show you my typical approach.</p>\n<p>First, install <code>npm-check-updates</code> package globally.</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code one-dark-pro\" style=\"background-color:#282c34;color:#abb2bf; overflow-x: auto; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#61AFEF\">npm</span><span style=\"color:#98C379\"> install</span><span style=\"color:#D19A66\"> -g</span><span style=\"color:#98C379\"> npm-check-updates</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span></code></pre>\n<p>Before making any updates, it‚Äôs a good idea to check all new dependencies that can be updated.</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code one-dark-pro\" style=\"background-color:#282c34;color:#abb2bf; overflow-x: auto; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#61AFEF\">ncu</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span></code></pre>\n<p>Most of the time, patch dependencies can be updated without affecting the project at all. So, I usually update patch dependencies by running either <code>ncu -i --target patch</code> or <code>ncu -u --target patch</code>. The difference is that <code>ncu -u --target patch</code> will update all the patches, while <code>ncu -i --target patch</code> will give an option to toggle which package to update. It‚Äôs up to you to decide which approach to take.</p>\n<p>The next part involves updating minor dependencies. Minor package updates usually won‚Äôt break the project, but it is always good to check the release notes of the respective packages. These minor updates often include some cool features that can be applied to our projects.</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code one-dark-pro\" style=\"background-color:#282c34;color:#abb2bf; overflow-x: auto; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#61AFEF\">ncu</span><span style=\"color:#D19A66\"> -i</span><span style=\"color:#D19A66\"> --target</span><span style=\"color:#98C379\"> minor</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span></code></pre>\n<p>Last but not least, there might be some major package updates in the dependencies.

If the package is a major version update, you have to be very careful since this will likely break the whole project. Therefore, please read the respective release note (or) docs very carefully and make changes accordingly.</p>\n<p>If you run <code>ncu -i</code> and found no more packages to be updated, <em><strong>Congrats!!!</strong></em> you have successfully updated all the dependencies in your project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"updating-astropaper-template\">Updating AstroPaper template</h2>\n<p>Like other open-source projects, AstroPaper is evolving with bug fixes, feature updates, and so on. So if you‚Äôre someone who is using AstroPaper as a template, you might also want to update the template when there‚Äôs a new release.</p>\n<p>The thing is, you might already have updated the template according to your flavor. Therefore, I can‚Äôt exactly show <strong>‚Äúthe one-size-fits-all perfect way‚Äù</strong> to update the template to the most recent release.

It‚Äôs like pure Android OS and other vendor-specific OSes like OneUI. The less you modify the base, the less you have to update.</p>\n<p>You can manually replace every file one by one, or you can use the magic of git to update everything.
