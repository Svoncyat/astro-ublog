This ends up being really useful for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent styles, but when you <em>really are</em> just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.</p>\n<p>We get lots of complaints about it actually, with people regularly asking us things like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my <code>h1</code> elements? How do I disable this? What do you mean I lose all the other base styles too?\nWe hear you, but we’re not convinced that simply disabling our base styles is what you really want. You don’t want to have to remove annoying margins every time you use a <code>p</code> element in a piece of your dashboard UI. And I doubt you really want your blog posts to use the user-agent styles either — you want them to look <em>awesome</em>, not awful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <code>@tailwindcss/typography</code> plugin is our attempt to give you what you <em>actually</em> want, without any of the downsides of doing something stupid like disabling our base styles.</p>\n<p>It adds a new <code>prose</code> class that you can slap on any block of vanilla HTML content and turn it into a beautiful, well-formatted document:</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code one-dark-pro\" style=\"background-color:#282c34;color:#abb2bf; overflow-x: auto; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">&#x3C;</span><span style=\"color:#E06C75\">article</span><span style=\"color:#D19A66\"> class</span><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">=</span><span style=\"color:#98C379\">\"prose\"</span><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">  &#x3C;</span><span style=\"color:#E06C75\">h1</span><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us&#x3C;/</span><span style=\"color:#E06C75\">h1</span><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">  &#x3C;</span><span style=\"color:#E06C75\">p</span><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">    with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an iconic status</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">    in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm, cheesy loaf for</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">    Halloween.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">  &#x3C;/</span><span style=\"color:#E06C75\">p</span><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">  &#x3C;</span><span style=\"color:#E06C75\">p</span><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">    But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">    series of rabies cases springing up around the country.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">  &#x3C;/</span><span style=\"color:#E06C75\">p</span><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#7F848E;font-style:italic\">  &#x3C;!-- ... --></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">&#x3C;/</span><span style=\"color:#E06C75\">article</span><span style=\"color:#ABB2BF\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span></code></pre>\n<p>For more information about how to use the plugin and the features it includes, <a href=\"https://github.com/tailwindcss/typography/blob/master/README.md\">read the documentation</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"what-to-expect-from-here-on-out\">What to expect from here on out</h2>\n<p>What follows from here is just a bunch of absolute nonsense I’ve written to dogfood the plugin itself.
